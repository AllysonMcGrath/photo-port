# Photography Portfolio-React

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a website using React.js. The site has an about me, contact, and different photography gallery sections. The photos displayed and the contact section are conditionally rendered based on the navigationt text selected. Gallery images open in modals. The contact section includes input validation.

### The User Story

AS AN avid traveler
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling 

GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection
WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit
THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit
WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection
THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated
